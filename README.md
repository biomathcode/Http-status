## ‚ö° Idea

### Story behind the idea

A while back i was working in a startup. We were three people mostly, backend developer, me the frontend guy and the idea guy. While working there the most of the issues that were related to http status and api calls. We mostly will keep asking "What's the response?".

As, the team got bigger and we added a lot of new interns. They too started working with api's and some of them would have a similar issue mostly. If some had a 401 issue I would have to tell them to authorize. 

### Actual Idea

> Either you are above the api or below the api

Http status is basically a custom issue field in a jira issue. I think it can be of great help while working on making rest apis. Since, most of the issue with the same response error will have the same solution. The frontend guys or the tester would be making the same mistakes, those issue can be solved and clubed together. 

This is a very simple, yet something which can give high utility and productivity. Highly helpful for days when the backend developer and fronend developer join their hands.
